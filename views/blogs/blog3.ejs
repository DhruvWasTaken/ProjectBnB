		<p>I’ve been visiting the city for years and have stayed in many of the city’s hostels. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.</p>
      <p>The top four when picking the best hostel in San Diego are:
        <ol>
          <li>Location – San Diego is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
            </li>
          <li>Price – In San Diego, you really get what you pay for, so if you go with a really cheap one, you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small, cramped, and doesn’t offer great service.
            </li>
          <li>Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi, and many have a free breakfast, but if you want more than that, be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs!
            </li>
          <li>Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below, be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!
            </li>
        </ol>
